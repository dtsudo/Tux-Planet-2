A sequel to [Tux Planet 1](https://github.com/dtsudo/Tux-Planet-Speedrun-Any-Percent). 

This game is a shmup where Konqi flies around and defeats various opponents!

## Build instructions

The game is written in Typescript; install Typescript and run it to generate the corresponding javascript files.

* Typescript relies on the `tsconfig.json` file to determine its configuration. In this case, our `tsconfig.json` file tells Typescript to compile every file in the `src` folder and place the result in the `built` folder.

## WIP

This is a work-in-progress (WIP).
